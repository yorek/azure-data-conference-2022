-- Should you *always* use a CTE/Subquery/View?
-- Keep in mind that
-- 1) data distribution may be really skewed
-- 2) query optimizer works with statistics, which have inherent errors 
--    that accumulate if there are many CTEs
-- try using a temp table (materializing the intermediate result) 
-- to check if it give better performances
